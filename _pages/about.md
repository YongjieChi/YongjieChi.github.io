I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Software, [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/), currently affiliated with the Visual Computing Group. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Gang Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/), and I also work within the larger research lab led by [Prof. Jiawan Zhang](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/zhangjiawan/index.html).

My research interests include computer vision, image generation, and cross-modal learning. I am particularly focused on generative models, multimodal representation learning, and controllable content synthesis. My current work explores effective conditioning mechanisms and representation alignment for visual generation and perception across heterogeneous modalities.

I am passionate about developing intelligent systems capable of understanding, generating, and interacting with complex visual information. My long-term goal is to contribute to the advancement of human-centered AI, bridging foundational research with real-world applications in creativity, design, and visual understanding.
